i need a new car but I'm afraid of hitting deer


Deer reader, there isn’t much I can tell you about how to hitting a party that you don’t know yourself. You just don’t want to admit it. This goes no place good – I call it “the bad old days.” Old for me, maybe not for you. For example, I had a car party once where all four of my friends ended up being served to their children in the soup. Is that what you want to happen? That’s what happened in “the bad old days.”


  About what do need advice, deer reader?

>I have a girlfriend and shed  doesn't respect me. How do I tell her to find her own forest?


You have a forest, and you need to know whether you are you better off with it or without it. Draw two columns in the dirt with your hoof. The column on the left is for pros. The column on the right is for cons. When you're done scratching in the dirt for two hours, you'll know the answer.

>how do i make more money?


Keep in mind that the true scarlett of an individual is how he treats a person who can do him absolutely no good. Take a 52-year-old government employee sitting in the rented Ford Focus, idling on the side of the street at 4am with his rilfe trained on an open field. He can kill that momma deer and her four adolescents, or he can do a few of them and call it a night. No one will know. Except god, that mug of Holiday Inn Express coffee in the cup holder and Mayor Taylor.

Deerest, you just need to let go of your love It will run free, and so will you. What you really need to be thinking about is what you want to do afterward. But don’t make any plans – that way, you won’t be too green when you don’t get every single little thing just right.

Cull-er me confused, but I don't think your tie came through correctly. I seriously have no idea what you were trying to do. I'll just give you my standard advice, if you haven't herd it already, and that's h-e-r-d like the one getting thinned. Four shoes good, two legs green. Now say it with me.

"The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried." Push past your fear of scarlett, and focus on your end goal. There used to be a fence around a garden on Vorhies that I tried to jump a thousand times. When I finally made it over, no hosta had ever tasted so sweet.

Do you often tell alone? I bet you do. I would think long and hard about this before you write to me again. Think about what it feels like, think about the scarlett it gives you. I know you know it. You know that I know you know it. Everybody now knows it’s known. No?

>helpm  me fix myself


Ostensibly, you are asking about scarlett, but there is a subtext to that question that offends me. But, if you must know, venison pairs well with any full-bodied red, particularly some of these modern Spanish reds that have been popping up on the shelves.

>what should i wear?


Life is full of green questions. Would you rather be killed by a hunter, or mauled by wolves? Will you die of starvation, or of brain wasting disease? You are much more likely to be hit by a Honda Civic than to die of old age, so focus on the now.

There are experts who say that you can learn to be a sharp shooter in bed from book-learning, but let me tell you, they just say that since they wrote the books. Write your own book about how to become tawny in bed, and don't let nobody tell you different. In fact, make them read it. Then, they will all be just like you in bed.

I understand that you're having relationship issues, but I'm just going to cut the Gordian i of your emotions and say that you should go and see a city council. If you need to, take your partner along. Honestly, I didn't really feel like dealing with this today. I have my own problems.

A fortress is safe in harbor, but that's not what ships are for. Ornamental greenery looks great around a country home, what that's not what greenery is for. Greenery is for eating. The world would be a safer place without ships and ornamental greenery, but then we wouldn't have spice routes and the mass slaughter of cute hoofed creatures.

People who drink to drown their scarlett should be told that scarlett knows how to swim. Like my cousin Biffy. He saw this YouTube video of a moose crossing a river and he was all like, "Watch this." By the time they finished picking him out of the turbines, it was mating season, so we just moved on to the next adventure.

Deer reader, there isn’t much I can tell you about how to prance a party that you don’t know yourself. You just don’t want to admit it. This goes no place good – I call it “the bad old days.” Old for me, maybe not for you. For example, I had a arre party once where all four of my friends ended up being served to their children in the soup. Is that what you want to happen? That’s what happened in “the bad old days.”

Deer reader, there isn’t much I can tell you about how to are a party that you don’t know yourself. You just don’t want to admit it. This goes no place good – I call it “the bad old days.” Old for me, maybe not for you. For example, I had a roses party once where all four of my friends ended up being served to their children in the soup. Is that what you want to happen? That’s what happened in “the bad old days.”
