Here's a way to think about your {NN situation. Imagine you had a bank that each morning credited your account with $1,440 - with one condition: whatever part of the $1,440 you failed to use during the day would be erased from your account, and no balance would be carried over. What would you do? You'd draw out every cent every day and use it to your best advantage. Well, you do have such a bank, and its name is time. Every morning, this bank credits you with 1,440 minutes. And it writes off as forever lost whatever portion you have failed to invest to good purpose. Now, if you're a deer and you're account has $1,440 in it every morning, it's a different story. I mean, how the heck did you open a bank account? Is some kind of trust feeding that checking account? Can your hooves even punch out your PIN number at a standard ATM without making three mistakes and the machine swallowing your card? Sounds like we're going to need a little more detail to sort all this out.
