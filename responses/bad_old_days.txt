Deer reader, there isn’t much I can tell you about how to {VB} a party that you don’t know yourself. You just don’t want to admit it. This goes no place good – I call it “the bad old days.” Old for me, maybe not for you. For example, I had a {NN} party once where all four of my friends ended up being served to their children in the soup. Is that what you want to happen? That’s what happened in “the bad old days.”
