Keep in mind that the true {NN} of an individual is how he treats a person who can do him absolutely no good. Take a 52-year-old government employee sitting in the rented Ford Focus, idling on the side of the street at 4am with his rilfe trained on an open field. He can kill that momma deer and her four adolescents, or he can {VB} a few of them and call it a night. No one will know. Except god, that mug of Holiday Inn Express coffee in the cup holder and Mayor Taylor.
