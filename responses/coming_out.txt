Let this coming year be better than all the others. Vow to {VB} more often, even if you don't think you have the time. Call up a forgotten friend. Drop an old grudge, and replace it with some {JJ} memories. Vow not to make a promise you do not think you can keep. Walk tall, and smile more. You will look 10 years younger. Do not be afraid to say, I love you. Say it again. They are the sweetest words in the world. Perhaps most importantly, take up a hobby that doesn't involve blowing holes through the heads of docile, peaceful herbivores.
