I know exactly what you really mean when you say "{NN}", and frankly I find the question repulsive and in poor taste. If you must know, we have a flavor reminiscent of beef, but it's richer and can have a gamey note. We tend to have a finer texture that's leaner than comparable cuts of beef. However, like beef, leaner cuts can be tougher as well. Sicko.
