Folks, I understand that we have a longtime listener, first-time culler on the line. I think the question was about whether {NN} should be mercilessly exterminated, or just the standard flora and fauna. That is to say, fauna. I think the answer depends on whether you plan to {VB} later on in the same day. They always say to wait a week, but I say at least double that, especially on an empty {NN}.
